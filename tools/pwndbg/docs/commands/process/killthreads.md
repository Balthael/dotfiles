# killthreads

## Description


Kill all or given threads.

Switches to given threads and calls pthread_exit(0) on them.
This is performed with scheduler-locking to prevent other threads from operating at the same time.

Killing all other threads may be useful to use GDB checkpoints, e.g., to test given input & restart the execution to the point of interest (checkpoint).
## Usage


```bash
usage: killthreads [-h] [-a] [thread_ids ...]

```
